Solid design principles in C++

Design principles introduced by Robert C. Martin

1. SRP - Single Responisbility Principle
"A class should only have a single reason to change"
Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems

2. OCP - Open-Closed Principle
"Open for extension, closed for modification"

3. Liskov Substition Principle
"You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype"

4. ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
"Don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces"
YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

5. DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
"High-level modules should not depend on low-level ones; use abstractions"
